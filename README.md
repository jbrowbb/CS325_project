# Indeed Resume and Job Summarizer
This program streamlines job searching by leveraging the power of Gemini's AI. It begins by processing your PDF resume to extract key information. Gemini then identifies relevant job titles and locations, which are used to query Indeed.com. The program retrieves the top 5-10 results, scrapes their text, and uses Gemini's AI again to generate concise summaries of job descriptions, salary expectations, and required skills. This sophisticated tool significantly reduces the time and effort involved in finding suitable job opportunities. The entire process, from resume analysis to summarized job details, is powered by the advanced capabilities of Gemini's AI, providing a seamless and efficient job search experience.
